My broader research agenda aims to understand how emerging technologies are integrated into on-going political dynamics, and how these processes of integration affect political outcomes. I have a particular interest in the the mutual influence between emerging technologies on the one hand, and the people and institutions that make up the state on the other, and historical cases of technological change as sources of new theoretical insights.

My research on the politics of data and internet governance has been published in [*International Relations of the Asia-Pacific*](https://academic.oup.com/irap/article/22/3/469/6514983), [*The Journal of Cyber Policy*](DOI:10.1080/23738871.2024.2413938), and [*The Peking University Law Journal*](https://doi.org/10.1080/20517483.2024.2445382).
